This is a project of my graduate course EEE 6412 : Heterostructures and Compound Semiconductor Device. Here, we studied the effect of Rapid Thermal Annealing in ohmic contact formation of GaN devices. 

Ohmic contact formation plays a crucial role in determining the electrical properties of AlGaN/GaN HEMT. Among various methods of ohmic contact formation, metal deposition followed by rapid thermal annealing is one of the effective ones. During RTA, the device is heated to a very high temperature around 1000째C either directly or with several intermediate stages in between. In AlGaN/GaN HEMT device, the ohmic contact is formed by Ti/Al/Ni/Au metal stack 
and with the help of RTA, AlN and TiN are formed at the metal semiconductor interface therefore creating an abundance of Nitrogen vacancies which serve as donors to provide path for electron tunneling. However, as this positive mechanism continues, there is also a negative process that degrades the contact resistivity because of Al-Au alloy formation. Therefore, it is necessary to find an optimal temperature and the duration for which the high temperature will be applied. Among  the reported conditions, multi-step annealing with (400째C 180 s + 700째C 40 s + 830째C 30 s) has shown to provide the lowest contact resistance proving its superiority over single step annealing.

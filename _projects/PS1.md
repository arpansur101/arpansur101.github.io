This project was completed during my Level-3, Term-1 for the EEE 306: Power Systems I Laboratory. We investigated the IEEE 39-bus network using PSAF software. Through analysis, we identified the impact of large unbalanced loads and HVDC connections within the network. To reduce overall power loss, we recommended reactive power compensation at specific nodes. This involved suggesting the appropriate power ratings for Static Var Compensators (SVC) at the optimal locations.

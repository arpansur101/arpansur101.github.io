This project was completed during my Level-3, Term-1 for the EEE 310: Communication Systems I Laboratory. In this project, we implemented AM DSB-WC in Proteus. Multiple users were present at the input, with each user's message modulated at a different carrier frequency. The modulated signals were transmitted through a shared communication channel, and at the receiver, the signals were demodulated for each user. Both coherent and non-coherent detection methods were demonstrated. Additionally, a controller was implemented, allowing the user to adjust the modulation index for transmission. The system also ensured proper demodulation at the receiver, even in cases of overmodulation.

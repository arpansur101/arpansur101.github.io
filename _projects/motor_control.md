This project was completed during my Level-3, Term-2 for the EEE 316: Power Electronics Laboratory. Here, we designed a DC motor controller and monitoring system. The system takes the intended speed (in rpm) from the user and employs a PID controller based feedback system to change the input PWM signal's DC level to a new value based on the intended speed. The system uses a hall effect sensor to measure the speed of the motor and arduino to implement the control system.

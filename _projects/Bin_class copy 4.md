This is a project of my Level-2, Term-1, presented in EEE 212 : Numerical Technique Laboratory. Here, we analysed 4 types of resonant circuits showing eith first order or second order resonance: series RLC, parallel RLC, cascaded RL and cascaded RC circuit.
We determined bandwidth, quality factor, resonant frequency, center frequency, cutoff frequency, transfer
function, bode plot of filter circuit.

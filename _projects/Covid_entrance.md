This project was completed during my Level-3, Term-2 for the EEE 318: Control Systems I Laboratory. We designed a safe, contactless entrance system, intended for use in industries with large workforces. To mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the system ensures that each worker is wearing a mask before entry. The system simultaneously detects mask usage, abnormal body temperature, and verifies the worker's ID card. If the worker has a normal body temperature, is wearing a mask, and possesses a valid work permit, the door opens. 

To demonstrate the project, temperature sensor, RFID sensor and a camera was used. **Live image classification** to detect the project was performed on the incoming image from the camera.

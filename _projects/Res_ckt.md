This project was completed during my Level-2, Term-1 for the EEE 212: Numerical Technique Laboratory. In this project, we analysed first and second order resonant circuits: Series RLC, Parallel RLC, Cascaded RL and Cascaded RC circuit analytically. From the analytical expressions, we determined **Bandwidth**, **Quality Factor**, **Resonant Frequency**, **Center Frequency**, **Cutoff Frequency**, **Transfer function** and **Bode plot of Filter Circuit** for the given resistance, capacitance and inductance value.

This is a project of my graduate course EEE 6412 : Heterostructures and Compound Semiconductor Device. In this project, we have investigated different ternary compounds, such as InAlN and ScAlN that can be used as barrier layer on GaN buffer in HEMT devices to increase two dimensional electron density in the channel and potentially replace conventional GaAlN/GaN HEMTs in future. We have begun our work by finding the lattice matching of the barrier layers with the buffer. Then, from literature, we have extracted the material parameters needed for band diagram simulation in BandEng. We have compared these parameters for the ternary compounds and provided insights on them. Finally, we have simulated the energy band diagrams for these devices in Bandeng.

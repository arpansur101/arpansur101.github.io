This project was completed during my Level-2, Term-2 for the EEE 208: Electronic Circuits II Laboratory. Here, we generated variable PWM signals using Op-Amp and MOSFET. Using that variable PWM signals as control signal, we controlled the speed of a motor. Additionally, a simple H bridge ciruit was implemented in order to enable bidirection operation in the project.

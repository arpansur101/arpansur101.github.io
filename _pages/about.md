I am currently working as a Research Fellow in the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE)][EEE-BUET] at [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)][UNI]. I completed my B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering in 2023 and currently pursuing an M.Sc. in the same department, specializing in Electronics and Photonics (EP) under the supervision of [Dr. Ahmed Zubair][DAZ]. My Master's thesis focuses on enhancing the performance of ultra-thin film perovskite solar cells beyond the visible spectrum through the incorporation of plasmonic nanoparticles.

Beyond my thesis, I also have experience designing graphene-based plasmonic waveguides and integrable plasmonic devices. I am currently developing 2D material-based nanoparticles that have potential medical applications. My research interests include **Plasmonics and Nanophotonics**, **Photonic Integrated Circuit**, **Ultrafast Optoelectronics**, **Non-linear Optics** and **Quantum Optics**. 

With the rapid advancements of the past century, traditional semiconductor electronics now faces limits in speed, energy efficiency, and processing power. Photonics is emerging as a faster, more efficient alternative to sustain technological progress. Beyond classical applications, photonics holds vast potential in quantum technologies. I believe photonic devices will be key to future innovations, and I am eager to contribute to this transformative field.
